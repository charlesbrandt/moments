SUMMARY:
----------
Moments is a python package to process moments log files. 
Moment log files are simple text documents with the format: 
        *YYYY.MM.DD hh:mm [tags]
        [entry]
        \n

        This simple format allows your notes to:
	  -stay accessible (no proprietary formats)
	  -be sorted by time or tag
	  -easily synchronize across many machines using a distributed version control system

REQUIREMENTS:
