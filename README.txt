Greetings!
Welcome to Moments!

Moments is a Python library that helps parse text based notes.  These notes are easy to create in a text editor.  The format is easy to read by a human and easy to parse with a computer.  These properties make it easy to sort and organize notes, and customize the sort process using this library. 

This project was started before Evernote and mobile apps emerged to help with keeping a personal journal.  Although this is a much lower level approach (and not as user friendly), I still use it as my primary means of keeping notes.
