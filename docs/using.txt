Usage
================

This assumes you already have a text file with some moment entries in it.  See '`Make Moments <processes.html#make-moments>`_' if not.

I'll base these examples off of a demonstration context, available with:
::

  hg clone https://bitbucket.org/context/context

Most interactions with the library involve loading a collection of moments from a log file into a Journal object:
::

  from moments.journal import Journal
  j = Journal("context/todo.txt")
  print len(j.entries())
  # 18!

If you want to load all moment log files contained in a directory, use load_journal():
::

  from moments.path import load_journal
  j = load_journal("context/")
  print len(j.entries())
  # 51

load_journal() will scan for text (.txt) files that start with a moment entry (*[date]).  It also looks for duplicate entries (based on the timestamp and entry data) and will try to merge tags automatically.  

From here there are many operations you can perform on a :class:`moments.journal.Journal`.  See the `Mindstream <https://bitbucket.org/cbrandt/mindstream>`_ module in the moments-scripts directory for examples.
