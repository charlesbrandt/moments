Using Moments
==================

I find it most natural to use a text editor with a built in timestamping / 'make new moment' / 'notice' macro in the text editor itself.  

I typically start with a new directory that contains a todo.txt and journal.txt file.  A more complete and detailed explanation of this process can be found here:

Managing Moments
--------------------

Moments are meant to be flexible enough to adapt to your way of organization. Since I use a text editor, I use different files for different contexts.  Over time, certain moments in a context become irrelevant, and other external moments are needed in that context.  This is where I find a tagging concept crucial.  With tags I am able to 'extract' tags from one set of moments ('Journal' in journal.py) and merge them in with another Journal.  If applicable, I'll add any relevant tags from the file's path in with the moment as they are extracted.  (sometimes the filename acts as a meta tag for all moments it holds). 

I have quite a few scripts in the mindstream module (TODO: link) that are mostly utility scripts for managing moments. They deal with different extract, merge, and splitting operations. 

Everything else just gets rolled down to a daily log, sorted by time.
