Installation
====================

The best way to get moments is to clone the mercurial repository:
::

  hg clone http://bitbucket.org/cbrandt/moments
  cd moments
  sudo python setup.py install

Another way to get moments is via easy_install. This version is not always the latest and greatest:
::

  sudo easy_install moments


Editors
----------

See the editors/ directory for different configurations for adding a time stamp command to your editor.  

Currently there are notes for Emacs, VI, and Gedit.  Evernote conversions are in the works. 


Requirements
----------------

Make sure you have the following items available on your computer:

- Python: (currently using versions 2.5 and up)
  http://www.python.org

- Image manipulations are an optional part of the path.py module and require:

  - Python Image Library (or Pillow)
  - jhead command line utility

- Mercurial/DVCS is useful for staying in sync with the source distribution, and also for synchronizing your own notes across different machines. 

Notes for installing and configuring a computer system that runs python are beyond the scope of this document.  For details and recommendations on this process, please see:
