Welcome to Moments!
===================================

Moments is a python package to process moments log files. 
Moment log files are simple text documents with the format: 
::

        *YYYY.MM.DD hh:mm [tags]
        [entry]
        \n

This simple format allows your notes to:

- be sorted by time or tag
- stay accessible (no proprietary formats)
- easily synchronize across many machines using a distributed version control system

Moments includes the path module (formerly a separate osbrowser package) to help navigate and represent the local file system as objects. 

Moments also includes a server to assist in serving moments to a separate process and then accessing them with a RemoteJournal object, just as you would with a normal Journal object.
