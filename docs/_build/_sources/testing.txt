Unit testing is a good habit to get into.  There are many unit testing frameworks for Python.  Pylons uses one called nosetests and I have been very pleased with it.  Here are a few notes I've collected on the topic:

in pylons project directory, should just be able to run 
nosetests

if tests are not being run, be sure that the test_* files do not have the executable permission flag set on the filesystem

nose will *IGNORE* those!

#2008.12.09 08:38:33 
sudo chmod -R 664 pose/tests/functional/*

make sure not to chmod the directory itself to 664... 
that will prevent the system from being able to browse dir!

nosetests --nocapture --with-pylons=test.ini
