Editors
===========

The main tool needed to create a journal is a text editor. 

There are many software applications for creating and editing text files.
Any of these will do.

Eventually, creating a the timestamp for a new entry will be tedious to do manually. For this reason, it is nice to use a system that will create them automatically.  When choosing one, just make sure you can always get your journal data back to the moment format outlined in moments.txt.  That will ensure your data is not locked in a proprietary format. 

One such system is Emacs.
See journal/emacs.txt for details on setting up Emacs on your system.

vi is another editor that is customizable.  See .exrc for adding journal/timestamp functions to vi.

Pose is a web based journalling application written in Python on top of the Pylons web framework.  Pose is included with Context.
For more information on running Pose, see:
code/python/pose/STARTUP.txt

Cameras also make good journaling tools.
Digital ones are getting more affordable and more powerful continually.
Portable, quick, easy to use...
The photo files have timestamps which can be read by the computer. Cool. :)

In a pinch, you can even use the command line with the included .bashrc... the terminal will print the timestamps for you! 
Just make sure your entries don't run anything you aren't expecting!

Using a tablet to input a journal entry is especially useful for non-textual hand drawn images.  See:

even screenshots could be used as a source of journal material!
