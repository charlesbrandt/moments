If you haven't already, you may want to reboot whatever computing system you're on.  

Next, synchronize any instances that you are already using.

Upgrading should only be required when major versions of Context are released.  
Minor versions are most easily updated using mercurial to pull all changes from the central repository at contextiskey.com.

Major version releases will include a fresh start in the revision history to minimize history clutter.  

This will require a migration of old instances to use the new structure, without the assistance of a version control system.

This is one reason to keep personal files not related to running the Context out of the main Context version control repository. 

This way, old instances can be moved to 
backups/instance_name

Then, as data is needed from the old instance, it can be moved into the correct repository. 

So...

Start with a fresh instance the easy way by cloning a Context to a personal branch.

hg clone /media/backups/context /media/backups/$NAME

#2009.01.24 14:46:14 ubuntu@ubuntu:/media/backups
hg clone context $NAME

#2009.01.24 14:46:25 ubuntu@ubuntu:/media/backups
mkdir $NAME/backups

#2009.01.24 14:46:36 ubuntu@ubuntu:/media/backups
mv $NAME-original $NAME/backups/$NAME-20090123

mv downloads downloads-temp
mv $NAME/backups/$NAME-20090123/downloads .
hg stat
#should only see downloads-temp as new files
rm -rf downloads-temp



move in any personal media repository
update links
reboot
