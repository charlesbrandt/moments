One of the things I really like about this format is that it works with good old pen and paper.

You may even have some old paper journals kicking about. 

Even in the case of paper it's good to stick with the format described in 
journal/moments.txt

This will help if you ever decided to digitize your analog notes in the future. 

film cameras would be another example of an analog journal.  It's even better if there is a date written on them somewhere!

Although analog processes are possible, everyone should have access to a computer as an option.
