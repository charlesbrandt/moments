Moments is a python module to parse text files in a journal format. 

This format is summarized as:

*YYYY.MM.DD mm:hh [tags]
entry
\n

Text files containing this format are referred to as Moment Logs (or just logs). There is an object to represent these in log.py

After parsing a log, an in memory python moments.Journal object can be created. Journals allow multiple logs to be merged, and support different ways of splitting up the entries.

See the ``docs/index.txt`` for information.
