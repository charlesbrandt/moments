Summarize
-------------

With so many events in life, it can be tricky to document the important ones.  It can be even more difficult to go back and summarize what happened and add information to help find those thoughts later.  

Meta data.  The information that describes the rest of the information.  How many times have you heard a song?  How would you classify what is in a photo? There are many programs that will help you create meta data, but they also tend to lock that information up into proprietary formats and rigid structures. 

Keeping a journal (with Moments) is a way of creating that meta data for events in life.  Text is a powerful way to condense and distill the personally meaningful results of these events.  After a while, however, those entries pile up.  A system is needed to retrieve thoughts based on a certain topic or concept.  

Summarizing looks at all of the different events over a certain period of time and either subjectively or objectively determines which ones are the most important ones to describe what happened in that time. 

Happy writing.  Peace.

Process
-----------

So far, much of this process is manual.  

I try to back up and synchronize my personal collection of moments every month.  Any more than that, and I find the process itself gets in the way of the rest of life. (Thrashing).  Any less than that and I find requests get lost in the shuffle, or are not responded to quickly enough.  

I have developed a process that works for me. This process gets very specific to personal organizational structures. 

I start with basic synchronizing scripts:

/c/moments/mercurial_sync.py

python /c/moments/moments/export.py /c/outgoing/ /media/CHARLES/outgoing/

The next part involves extracting items with currently active repositories. The rest of the moments are split into days:

/c/mindstream/moments-scripts/split_logs_to_days.py /c/journal/incoming /c/journal

/c/mindstream/moments-scripts/sort_month.py /c/journal/2012/$MM

So that gets everything in one place and sorted.  But that can still be a lot of information, even for just one month.  By convention, I tag entries that summarize blocks of time longer than a single moment with the tag 'summary'. 

If you take a lot of pictures, and have a way to sort through them, they can help with outlining a month summary. 

Pose can also help summarize:
Start a moments server:
python /c/moments/moments/server.py /c/journal 

the start a pose server:
cd /c/mindstream/pose"
echo "python application-split.py -c /c/journal"

http://localhost:8088/range/201202/20120229235959

Hope that helps!
