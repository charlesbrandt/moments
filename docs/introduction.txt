“But the fact is that writing is the only way in which I am able to cope with the memories which overwhelm me so frequently and so unexpectedly. If they remained locked away, they would become heavier and heavier as time went on, so that in the end I would succumb under their mounting weight. Memories lie slumbering within us for months and years, quietly proliferating, until they are woken by some trifle and in some strange way blind us to life…And yet, what would we be without memory? We would not be capable of ordering even the simplest thoughts, the most sensitive heart would lose the ability to show affection, our existence would be a mere never-ending chain of meaningless moments, and there would not be the faintest trace of a past.”

Introducing Moments:
=====================

Moments is python module for reading, creating, and processing notes and logs.  It uses a simple and consistent text based format that is easy for both humans and computers to create and read.  The python modules helps you organize these notes in a way that makes sense to you, and change that organization as your outlook on organization changes. 

The moment log format is easy to read and create without special software.  The moments python module gives developers a quick way to create software that utilize the format. 

I like to start by thinking about moments in terms of a personal journal or diary.  From there it is easy to expand to other applications.

Why Moments?
===============

Computers are at the heart of modern day record keeping.  There are a number of different systems and formats for organizing your information.  Unfortunately, there are drawbacks including:
 - proprietary formats
 - narrow focus of what type of information is stored
 - difficult for humans to read/create

This results in fragmentation of information across many different types of systems, both local and remote.  When we want to change solutions (or worse yet, the services disappear) we often must leave the information associated with that service behind.  If you trust these memories to a computer, this can result in big gaps in your digital history.  

Enter Moments.

- Keep meta data mixed in with binary files.  This allows you to organize and sort binary data without losing track of the meta data.  If meta data is stored in the database, links may be broken after moving binary data.  This is why programs like iTunes prefer to handle sorting for you. 

- Split meta data into separate locations.  Related to previous point, but if you want to move part of the meta data to a different machine, it is easy to split it up accordingly. 

These things are possible with databases, but databases add one more dependency into the equation.  They also require a potentially unintuitive process to split data.
