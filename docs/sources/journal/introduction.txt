Starting A New Journal:

A journal is simply a collection of journal entries.

There are 3 main parts to a journal entry:

-The time it was made
-The entry description (what was done, thought, said, heard, etc)
-Keywords/tags associated with that entry

An entry represents a specific moment.  In other words, a moment has a time it was started (or finished, or both), a description, and some tags or keywords.

For more details about the format of an entry (moment) used in this software, check:
journal/moments.txt
