EMACS:
-------------

Emacs is a cross platform, open-sourced (GPL) text editor that is easy to customize.  With a few simple customizations included with Context, Emacs will create timestamps in your journal for you.

Mac OS X:
I personally use Carbon Emacs:

Aquamacs Emacs is another great option:

Ubuntu:
Instructions for installing emacs on Ubuntu are also included in the system/startup.txt file and system/startup.sh script.

The code needed to customize Emacs to automatically create timestamps and new journal entries is included in:
code/lisp/.emacs
and 
code/lisp/.emacs.d

Specifically, the code to print journal stamps is available in:
code/lisp/.emacs.d/journal.el

Link or copy these files to your home directory, or your C:\ drive in windows.
