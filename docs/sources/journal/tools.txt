The main tool needed to create a journal is a text editor. 

There are many software applications for creating and editing text files.
Any of these will do.

Eventually, creating a the timestamp for a new entry will be tedious to do manually. For this reason, it is nice to use a system that will create them automatically.  When choosing one, just make sure you can always get your journal data back to the moment format outlined in moments.txt.  That will ensure your data is not locked in a proprietary format.
