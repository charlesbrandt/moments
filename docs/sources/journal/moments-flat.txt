Context uses the following format convention for journal entries:

description
[blank line]

or more compactly:

description
\n

It really is as simple as that!  :)

If you would like further clarification, please see the python module included to process Moment Logs (Journals):
code/python/moments

The moment object definition (Entry) is defined in:
code/python/moments/moments/entry.py 

The object that reads in text files and generates Entry objects is defined in:
code/python/moments/moments/log.py
