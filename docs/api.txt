API Documentation
=================

This page outlines the main modules provided by the Moments python package.

Text files containing this format are referred to as moment logs (or just logs). There is an object to represent these in moments.log.py

After parsing a log, an in memory python moments.Journal object can be created. Journals allow multiple logs to be merged, and support different ways of splitting up the entries.

For further details, please view the python source code directly.
