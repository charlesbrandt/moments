Python is included with many operating systems.  

An easy way to check if your system already has Python is to open up a terminal / command prompt and type:

python -V

for example:
python -V
Python 2.5.2

If your operating system does not have Python installed, please visit:
http://www.python.org
For more information on downloading and installing Python for your system.

The other component that you will need to install is the Python Imaging Library (often abbreviated as PIL).

Binaries for windows are available at the main site.  Binary packages are much easier to install than from source.   

For Mac OS X you can use ports, or find a binary package like the following:
http://pythonmac.org/packages/py25-fat/index.html
This also requires the 2.5 version of Python from python.org. (The one distributed with Leopard won't work)

also [2009.06.26 13:19:06] 
after installing the python from python.org, make sure that the python in the default path is using the latest python
which python
python -V
should be 2.5.4

sudo rm /usr/bin/python
sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/python /usr/bin/python

sudo rm /usr/bin/pythonw
sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/pythonw /usr/bin/pythonw

notes for this are elsewhere
but this is also a good time to install mercurial

on Mac OS X this does require Xcode to be up to date
(can still download an executable for mac)
