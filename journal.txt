wow...
it's been a while since making changes here

a few bug fixes here and there... a few tweaks... but really it's been quite stable.

I am running up against some limitations of using .txt files and loading everything in to memory. Investigating the use of couchdb as a persistence layer. Hoping that this also makes it easier to synchronize with mobile devices.

slowly migrate moments module to use a simplified journal object
only include scripts that have been tested with the new code

good chance to review what is there

*2011.09.02 14:26:55 complete
those are with mindstream repository

requested [2011.08.01 11:00:56] 
merge moments-web and pose2
consider integration with moments2 ???

*2011.09.02 14:26:30 complete
should be mostly there
anything found missing can be brought back from archives
requested [2011.07.15 14:36:14] 
continue to move other functionality for moments not in moments2 to either: pose2, or mindstream

*2011.07.15 14:34:54 
I think these were both complete as the RemoteJournal was created
requested [2011.06.28 22:47:49] 
move all html formatting out of moment/entry module

requested [2011.06.28 22:45:38] 
can we consolidate moment and entry? 
entry is just a moment without a timestamp
now that journal accepts those, can handle those...
we don't need a distinction

also [2011.06.30 09:08:58] 
the only thing that will be lost is a moment's ability to automatically set the timestamp to 'now'
i think that is worth the simplification
in practice, journal.make is used



*2011.06.28 19:55:07 complete nose nosetests
nosetests -s --exe

gets around the issue
-s prints output regardless

requested [2011.06.28 19:49:15] nose
nosetests won't run on files that are set to executable
files on NTFS drive cannot change permissions
nose won't run automatically there.

*2011.06.28 21:09:45 
removed entry.tag_links() function to /c/player/graph package
this should happen on its own.
requested [2011.06.28 21:09:26] 
    huh?
    is this useful for graphing?
    might want to make it part of graphing package if so.


*2011.06.26 22:47:09 complete
in moments.journal.Journal
all methods *_entry
renamed
see "migration" notes in todo
requested [2011.06.26 13:54:52]
following should not need "entry" in the name
plural versions can keep "entries"
