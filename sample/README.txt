Hi!
Welcome to Context!

Context is available at contextiskey.com. 
Context is free and open source software. 
Context is released under the MIT license.  (See: LICENSE.txt)

This software was made possible by the love of TCB, my family, my teachers and my friends.  
Thank you!

Have fun. Take care. Be free. Be happy. Namaste.

SUMMARY:
----------
Context provides an open and portable system to keep track of thoughts, memories and moments.  
This process is called journaling.

A Context gives a frame of reference to the collected moments in effort to make them easy to retrieve and review as technologies and times change. 

More information about journaling is included under:
journal/
journal/introduction.txt 

A computer makes a good journaling tool.  Almost any should do the job.

If you don't have a computer, don't let that stop you! There are other ways:
journal/lotech.txt

Start with what is available to you. Start where you're at. Start now()! :)

SYSTEM NOTES:
-----------------
Context aims to be usable on as many different computer operating systems as possible.  
 
Notes on setting up different operating systems are included in:
system/

If you don't already have a preference in operating systems, you might try Ubuntu.
http://www.ubuntu.com

For more details on installing a new Ubuntu system, see:
system/startup.txt

Also, for running from an Ubuntu live session, you can try:
system/startup.sh
Be sure to update $NAME to be your name/username and $USBPATH to point to where this instance is.

REQUIREMENTS:
----------------
Make sure you have the following items available on your computer:

Python: (currently using versions 2.5.x)
http://www.python.org
code/python/install.txt

Text Editor of choice:
journal/tools.txt

Version Control System of choice (optional, but strongly encouraged!):
administrator/version_control.txt

Once you have those items, let's get started!

GETTING STARTED:
-------------------
Using your text editor, open two files in separate windows (or buffers, tabs, etc).

One for your "journal" entries (the past) called journal.txt.
One for your "todo list" items (the future) called todo.txt.

Two files are included as templates for starters:
journal.txt
todo.txt

If this is your first time with Context, start working through the items in todo.txt to get acquainted with the simple concepts behind the system. 

otherwise...

CHECK LIST:
------------
terminal open? 
file system browser open? 
system beep disabled?
desktop background set?
last instance loaded from instance_notes? 
workspace preferences open? 
usb sync?

ok... here we go.
