wonder if it's better to use the next cycle's start as the current cycle's end
instead of the second before the next cycle's start

as an example:
if the day is:
20101013 
the start is
201010130000
the end is currently
20101013235959
but it might make more sense to just say the end is actually:
20101014
when testing for inclusion, ends can be treated differently...
i.e. if something has a start that == another end, it's not overlapping

consider renaming Timerange to TimeRange
(maybe also Timestamp to TimeStamp?)
