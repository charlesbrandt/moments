Gedit ships with a plug-in that is enabled by default for inserting the date and time. 
This functionality can be found under:
Edit->Insert Date and Time...

To conform to the moments date/timestamp, use a custom format as follows:
*%Y.%m.%d %H:%M:%S 

To quickly access this command, type:
Alt-E, S, Enter

also [2010.03.15 12:04:15] 
you can also configure the plugin under Preferences to use a certain format by default
this allows you to only press Alt-E S to get a timestamp
seems pretty easy

does not jump to the beginning of the file, as the command in emacs, but not bad for out of the box functionality!!  Thanks GEdit.

requested [2009.11.12 17:05:09] todo 20091112
make a request to gedit to include a timestamping feature bound to CTRL-J
