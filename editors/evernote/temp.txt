<div>sounds like they got started around 2008</div>

<div>Moments was timely, but far too slow to keep up with demand.  </div>

tag autocomplete is cool
<div><br/></div>
<div>I'm sure the searching is pretty nice</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>automatic syncing (as mentioned)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>other meta data fields (location, author, url)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>entry formatting</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>audio</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>video</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I'm sure there will be more as I use it more.  Just hoping that the promotions don't ruin it for me.  (I'm not sure I see enough value for paying... note taking is something that should be free IMO)</div>

Downsides

In some ways, it is trickier to add tags (maybe that is what I should use the title for?)
<div><br/></div>
<div>No linux support</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Ads / Promotions in non-premium version</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Everything is public (I'm counting a password protected account as public in this case, even though that is not technically public).</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Monthly limits in free version.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>That's about all I can come up with at this point, which really isn't much.  It's a nice system.  Moments will still have it's place for lower level operations, and it is very functional. It could be good for embedding journalling/note tracking into other applications and web services.  </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>But for public cases, this might be a nice way to go.  </div>

<p>notes from client already show up in the web version.  This is being created on the web version... at what point does it show up in the client?</p>
<p>(After pressing Done? .. yep)</p>

Looks like they have it all figured out in a nice package... tags, locations, nice UI on multiple platforms.  Multiple formats.  What about exporting?
<div><br/></div>
<div>Yup... it's there too...</div>
<div>File -&gt; Export Notes to Archive...</div>
