*2008.12.18 21:00:57 foo bar
another test, need more for limiting

*2008.10.22 11:15:42 foo
another test entry, this one has seconds

*2008.02.25 00:35 foo bar

dummy log file for testing Log module (and eventually others)

2009.03.03 14:41:56 
the previous timestamp should not trigger a new entry
it does not begin with a "*", which is no longer valid for a moment log entry
should be part of [2008.02.25 00:35]

be sure that this file ends in a blank line:

*2010.03.13 15:15:08 
another entry just to make sure extra new lines on last entry aren't causing the two similar entries in this log (sample_log3.txt) and the other log being merged (sample_log.txt) isn't causing the two entries to be marked as different.

if you want to test that, copy this moment to sample_log.txt and make sure each has a different number of newlines following it. 

(a good test, just not what was being tested by the previous (by textual position in this file) [2008.02.25 00:35] entry)

extra new lines should not be added / removed at the end of a file
but shouldn't truncate automatically... can test that by placing the duplicate entry in the other file not at the end of the log.

one blank line after this one.
